> [❗] Look through the setup process before using this project so that you can avoid errors.

## Setup Process

> ❗Make sure You have python3 and pip installed on your machine.

### Step 1

1. Create a folder where you want to clone the project.
   - I am creating a folder named ‘example’ in desktop

2. Now navigate to "example" via cmd or terminal

(Mac)

```bash
cd ~/desktop/example
```

(Windows)

 ```shell
cd C:\Users\YourDesktopName\Desktop\example
 ```

### Step 2

> ℹ️ *Optional but better to use a virtual environment for every project.*

If don’t have any virtual environment manager installed in your machine then install one. (I will use pipenv)

For installing pipenv run

```bash
pip install pipenv
``

1. Install all the dependencies for the project.


```bash
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
pipenv shell
```

### Step 3

1. Create a .env file in the project directory, open it with your favorite text editor and paste the bellow lines

```.file
SECRET_KEY=[YOUR SECRET_KEY]
DEBUG=True
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=[YOUR MAILCHIMP_API_KEY]
MAILCHIMP_DATA_CENTER=[YOUR MAILCHIMP_DATA_CENTER]
MAILCHIMP_EMAIL_LIST_ID=[YOUR MAILCHIMP_DATA_CENTER]
```

2. Now generate a secret key for your project.

run python on your shell

```bash
python
```

``` python
>>>from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
>>>get_random_secret_key()
>>>[ YOUR SECRET KEY ]
```

3. Copy the secret key, open .env file again and assign the secret key. If you don't have mailchimp credentials then make sure your file look like this

```.file
SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
DEBUG=True
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=''
MAILCHIMP_DATA_CENTER=''
MAILCHIMP_EMAIL_LIST_ID=''
```

> ⚠️ make sure not to use any space between the equal(=) sign or any quotations(“) for the secret key

> ℹ️
> If you want to setup Mailchimp now then go to this [section](mailchimp_setup.md)

4. Make a migrations.

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```

5. You are all setup, let’s migrate now.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

6. Create a superuser to rule the site 😎

```bash
python manage.py create superuser

```

> *follow the instructions*

6. Hahh! Long wait. Let’s visit the site now
